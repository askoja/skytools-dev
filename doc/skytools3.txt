Skytools 3 - cascaded replication
=================================

Keep old design from Skytools 2
-------------------------------

* Worker process connects to only 2 databases, there is no
  everybody-to-everybody communication going on.
* Worker process only pulls data from queue.
  - No pushing with LISTEN/NOTIFY
  - Administrative work happens in separate process
  - Can go down anytime, without affecting anything else
* Relaxed attitude about tables
  - Tables can be added/removed any time.
  - Inital sync happens table-by-table, no attempt is made to keep
    consistent picture between tables when syncing.

New features in Skytools 3
--------------------------

* Cascading is implemented as generic layer on top of PgQ - *Cascaded PgQ*.
  - Its goal is to keep identical copy of queue contents in several nodes.
  - Not replication-specific - can be used for any queue.

* New Londiste features:
  - Parallel copy - during inital sync several tables can be
    copied at the same time.   In 2.1.x the copy already happened in separate
    process, making it parallel was just a matter of tuning launching/syncing logic.

  - EXECUTE command, to run random SQL script on all nodes.

  - Automatic table or sequence creation by importing the structure
    from provider node.  Activeted with --create switch for add-table, add-seq.

* Advanced admin operations:
  - switchover
  - failover
  - change provider for node
  - pause / resume node
  - rename node
