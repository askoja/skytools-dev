Keep old design from Skytools 2.x:
----------------------------------

* worker process connects to only 2 databases
* worker process pulls data, no pushing with LISTEN/NOTIFY
* relaxed attitude about tables
  - can be added/removed any time.
  - inital sync happens table-by-table, no attempt is made to keep
    consistend picture between tables when syncing.

New features in 3.0:
--------------------

* Queue content are kept in sync between all nodes in node-set.
* parallel copy - during inital sync several tables can be
  copied at the same time.
